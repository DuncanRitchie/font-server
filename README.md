# Duncanâ€™s font server
https://fonts.duncanritchie.co.uk/

This is a host for Alegreya, the typeface I use across my personal projects.
Follow the link for more details, but it might not be very interesting to anyone other than myself!

It means that using the Alegreya fonts is as simple as `<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://fonts.duncanritchie.co.uk/subsites.css">`
